  \lhead{\emph{Conclusion}}

Although I significantly corrected current estimate of game complexity, still,
in terms of creating agent able to play Quoridor utilizing
both artifitial neural network with Q-learning method I was not completely
successful, since it did not show signs of notable improvement.
It could be necessary to play many more games to start improving or to provide
the game state information encoded in the different way.
