% 1. we play games because it is in our nature, it helps us to improve
% 2. one such game helping us to improve is Quoridor with these rules
% 3. there are many ways to solve games, such as QL or ANN
% 4. no big success even with ANN
% 5. i will try to implement ANN with QLNN

Since it is in our nature to play games, we seek for better opponents to
improve ourselves.
There are variety of games where we can enhance our mental abilities.
However, there were found optimal strategies for some of them, which may
sometimes seem eigther less challenging or even less interresting.
Nevertheless, game Quoridor is not among these yet.
Considering it has been invented relatively recently, attempts realized
to create a computer agent have been scarce.
Additionaly, there has been no success with the use of artifitial neural
networks.
And this is what within the scope of this thesis I will try to accomplish.

To train neural network, I will create opponent with simple heuristics.
Moreover, I will combine Q-learning with networks ability to generalize
to estimate best action.
